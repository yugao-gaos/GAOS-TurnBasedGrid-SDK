# Capabilities

GAOS is a composable deterministic tabletop SDK. A game can use one mechanism
family by itself or combine several through a product-owned `TurnReducer`.
Boards are optional: card games, drafting games, hidden-role games, abstract
graph games, and hybrid board/zone games use the same reducer, agent, and replay
contracts.

## Capability map

| Domain | SDK-owned capabilities | Example game shapes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turn models | Sequential rotation, simultaneous intent collection, response priority, phases, high-frequency lockstep, frame skip | Chess-like turns, WEGO strategy, reaction stacks, tick-based tactics |
| Boards and locations | Square, axial-hex, graph, multi-board, paths, lines, fields, keyed footprints | Tactics, territory maps, node networks, dungeon rooms |
| Zones and collections | Ordered decks, hidden hands, bags, queues, sparse slots, atomic transfer, shuffle, draw, deal | Card games, drafting, inventories, production queues, worker placement |
| Information | Per-seat observations, hidden identity/order, fog, shells, teams, revelations, spectators, leak assertions | Hidden cards, fog of war, social deduction, team games |
| Composition | Keywords, targets, durations, phases, response windows, patterns, deck/loadout validation | Trading-card effects, buffs, interrupts, set collection, squad building |
| Resolution | Settlement waves, movement contention, resource claims, arrivals, portals, pushes, projectiles, transport, gates, triggers | Chain reactions, simultaneous movement, hybrid board/zone transit |
| Agents | Single- and multi-agent environments, legal-action expansion, rewards, batch evaluation, model drivers, CLI launchers | Model evaluation, self-play, tournaments, regression agents |
| Verification | Seeded randomness, solver, state digests, resimulation, portable JSONL replay, multi-level recheck | Benchmarks, leaderboards, dispute verification, reproducible bug reports |
| Integration | Genre-neutral turn protocol, retry-safe cursors, participation windows, TypeScript and Python clients | Local play, hosted sessions, P2P plus verifier, authoritative matches |

## Turn models

GAOS does not require one cadence.

- **Sequential:** immutable seat rotation, reversals, skips, extra turns,
  elimination, and round tracking.
- **Simultaneous:** collect one intent per participating seat, then apply a
  canonical atomic batch without request-arrival bias.
- **Response priority:** open a response window, rotate priority, collect
  passes or reactions, and unwind pending work deterministically.
- **High frequency:** record sparse tick inputs, resimulate omitted empty
  ticks, digest canonical state, and frame-skip between meaningful decisions.

The product decides when a turn ends, which seats may act, and which actions
are legal. The SDK owns the reusable ordering and replay rules.

## Containers, not just grids

`LocationRef` addresses a place inside any named container. That container can
be a board, graph, deck, hand, bag, queue, or authored slot row.

### Spatial containers

- bounded square layouts;
- axial-hex layouts;
- directed or undirected graph layouts;
- multiple boards in one state;
- generic keyed pathfinding, line of sight, fields, and footprints.

### Collection containers

- LIFO/FIFO/any-index ordered zones;
- unordered seeded bags;
- sparse named slots;
- hidden or seat-visible identity and order;
- atomic planning and commit for transfers, draws, deals, and arrivals.

### Hybrid containers

Portals move entities across heterogeneous containers—for example, a token can
leave a hex board, enter a hidden bag, then emerge on a graph node. Capacity,
group movement, transformations, cycles, and arrivals resolve atomically.

## Card and tabletop composition

The zone primitive is intentionally lower-level than a card-game framework.
Products compose it with:

- layered static, granted, and suppressed keywords;
- declarative targets across boards and zones;
- turn/round/phase/tick durations;
- explicit phase hooks;
- nested response windows and LIFO resolution;
- deterministic shuffle, draw, round-robin deal, and batch deal;
- structured deck, squad, and loadout validation;
- maximal-run and authored-motif pattern recognition.

A card-only game imports no geometry or movement code. A tactics game can use
the same mechanisms for inventories, action decks, status effects, and
overwatch responses.

## Hidden information and multiplayer

`viewFor(state, seat)` is the trust boundary for player and agent observations.
Helpers support independent identity and order visibility, board fog/shells,
teams, revelations, spectators, and conventional leak tests.

Deployment depends on the secrecy requirement:

- Perfect-information games can use local or optimistic P2P lockstep and
  escalate divergent transcripts to a verifier.
- Hidden-information games require an authoritative resolver that retains
  secrets and sends each participant only its redacted view.

Deterministic P2P agreement provides integrity evidence; it cannot provide
confidentiality when every peer possesses the secret state.

## Deterministic resolution

The settlement kernel and focused mechanisms cover:

- multi-wave consequence worklists with convergence guards and causal traces;
- simultaneous keyed movement, swaps, collisions, priorities, and footprints;
- resource claims and atomic resource transactions;
- arrivals, gates, triggers, rays, projectiles, pushes, transport, and
  interlocks;
- breadth-first chain reactions;
- bounded portal traversal and destination contention;
- product-schema-neutral behavior trees.

Each mechanism receives product callbacks for meaning and mutation. GAOS owns
ordering and failure semantics; the game owns rules content and presentation.

## Agents and benchmarks

`AgentEnvironment` and `MultiAgentEnvironment` expose concrete legal actions
from the same reducer used by ordinary play. They support seat-redacted views,
frame skip, per-seat rewards, safety truncation, batch evaluation, provider
drivers, portable tools, and CLI-backed agents.

The `gaos.replay` JSONL envelope then packages the evidence:

- game and historical reducer-adapter identity;
- pinned levels and explicit per-level seeds;
- canonical level-indexed actions;
- recorded results and aggregate totals;
- strict parsing, canonical serialization, and whole-run recheck.

This allows a creator-platform game and a hosted Arena run to be verified by
the same SDK tooling.

## What remains product-owned

GAOS does not prescribe characters, cards, terrain, objectives, scoring
meaning, legal-action policy, prompts, matchmaking, persistence, rendering,
animation, seasons, or content distribution. It also does not make secret
state safe on an untrusted peer.

The boundary is consistent:
