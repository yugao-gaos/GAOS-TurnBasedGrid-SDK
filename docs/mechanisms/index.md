# Mechanism reference

The `./engine` package is a set of deterministic, product-neutral building
blocks for turn-based grid games. Each page in this section describes one
mechanism family: the state it expects, the ordering it guarantees, the policy
the product must inject, and the edge cases an integration should test.

Every mechanism page also ends with a **Zonoid example**. Zonoid is the first
production consumer of this engine: its universal grid reducer supplies the
board, characters, abilities, authored levels, and presentation policy while
the SDK supplies the deterministic algorithm.

## How the pieces fit together

```text
submitted action
    │
    ├─ reducer validates product rules
    │
    ├─ simultaneous movement / push / transport proposal
    │
    └─ settlement waves
          ├─ arrival rules
          ├─ resource claims
          ├─ gates and triggers
          ├─ projectiles, rays, and chain reactions
          └─ linked-state interlocks
                 │
                 └─ stable turn view, score, transcript
```

The SDK does not prescribe that exact pipeline. A product composes only the
mechanisms it needs and explicitly schedules their causal relationships through
the [settlement kernel](/settlement).

## Pages

| Family | What the SDK guarantees |
|---|---|
| [Grid model](grid-model.md) | Coordinates, action shapes, observations, and the reducer boundary |
| [Simultaneous movement](movement.md) | Collision, priority, footprints, chains, rotations, and swaps |
| [Geometry and FOV](geometry.md) | Cardinal paths, nearest reachable cells, lines, sight, and cones |
| [Turn settlement](/settlement) | Multi-wave consequence scheduling, duplicate policy, traces, and limits |
| [Chain reactions](chain-reactions.md) | Breadth-first, once-per-identity propagation |
| [Projectiles and flight](projectiles.md) | Snapshot-safe microsteps and bounded full-flight passes |
| [Push chains](push-chains.md) | Mutation-free planning and safe commit order |

## Product integration showcases

These focused boards show how Zonoid composes several SDK mechanisms into
player-facing interactions while retaining the normal game UI.

## Shared conventions

- **Stable identities are data.** Entity, job, trigger, claim, and rule ids must
  be stable across replay.
- **Lower priority values run first.** Where priorities tie, the documented
  stable input or id order decides the result.
- **Bounds are authored.** Maximum steps, passes, reactions, nodes, and cycles
  are safety limits supplied by the product; they are not balance rules chosen
  by the SDK.
- **Callbacks own meaning.** Tokens, terrain, damage, abilities, objectives,
  animation events, and persistence stay in the product.
- **Determinism includes ordering.** Do not feed unordered database results or
  locale-dependent comparisons into a mechanism without normalizing them.

Import all mechanisms from the dedicated subpath:

```ts
import {
  resolveMoves,
  runSettlementCascade,
  shortestGridPath,
} from '@yugao-gaos/turn-based-grid-sdk/engine';
```
