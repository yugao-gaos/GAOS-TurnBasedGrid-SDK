# Mechanism reference

The `./engine` package is a set of deterministic, product-neutral building
blocks for tabletop games. Each page in this section describes one
mechanism family: the state it expects, the ordering it guarantees, the policy
the product must inject, and the edge cases an integration should test.

No board is required. Card-only and hidden-role games can use zones,
information partitions, turn order, response windows, agents, and replay
without importing geometry. Spatial games can choose square, axial-hex, or
graph layouts, and hybrid games can connect boards and zones through portals.

Established mechanism pages also include focused **Zonoid examples**. Zonoid
is the first production consumer of this engine: its universal reducer
supplies authored content and presentation policy while the SDK supplies the
deterministic algorithms.

## How the pieces fit together

```text
submitted action
    │
    ├─ reducer validates product rules
    │
    ├─ simultaneous movement / push / transport proposal
    │
    └─ settlement waves
          ├─ arrival rules
          ├─ resource claims
          ├─ gates and triggers
          ├─ projectiles, rays, and chain reactions
          └─ linked-state interlocks
                 │
                 └─ stable turn view, score, transcript
```

The SDK does not prescribe that exact pipeline. A product composes only the
mechanisms it needs and explicitly schedules their causal relationships through
the [settlement kernel](/settlement).

## Product integration showcases

These focused boards show how Zonoid composes several SDK mechanisms into
player-facing interactions while retaining the normal game UI.

## Shared conventions

- **Stable identities are data.** Entity, job, trigger, claim, and rule ids must
  be stable across replay.
- **Lower priority values run first.** Where priorities tie, the documented
  stable input or id order decides the result.
- **Bounds are authored.** Maximum steps, passes, reactions, nodes, and cycles
  are safety limits supplied by the product; they are not balance rules chosen
  by the SDK.
- **Callbacks own meaning.** Tokens, terrain, damage, abilities, objectives,
  animation events, and persistence stay in the product.
- **Determinism includes ordering.** Do not feed unordered database results or
  locale-dependent comparisons into a mechanism without normalizing them.

Import all mechanisms from the dedicated subpath:

```ts
import {
  resolveMoves,
  runSettlementCascade,
  shortestGridPath,
} from '@yugao-gaos/turn-based-grid-sdk/engine';
```
