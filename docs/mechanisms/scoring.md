# Scoring and AI action limits

The scoring helpers implement a small product-neutral star model. AI action
limits are separate runtime guardrails; product economy belongs to the generic
[resource transaction system](resources.md).

## Star thresholds

`scoreStars` uses inclusive action thresholds:

```ts
scoreStars(6, { three: 6, two: 9 });  // 3
scoreStars(7, { three: 6, two: 9 });  // 2
scoreStars(10, { three: 6, two: 9 }); // 1
```

The function assumes the three-star threshold is no greater than the two-star
threshold. It does not validate authored data. A completed run always receives
one, two, or three stars; failure and incomplete-run policy belongs outside this
function.

## AI action limit

`aiActionLimitExceeded` checks the runtime guardrail independently of product
resources:

```ts
if (aiActionLimitExceeded({ actionsUsed, maxActions })) {
  // stop this agent run
}
```

The deprecated `budgetFailure` helper remains for compatibility with existing
integrations. New code should model energy as a product-defined resource and
use resource transaction failures for affordability.

## Deprecated combined budget failure

`budgetFailure` compares cumulative usage with caps using `>=`:

```ts
const failure = budgetFailure({
  actionsUsed,
  maxActions: level.actionBudget,
  energyUsed,
  energyCap: level.energyCap,
});
```

When both limits are reached on the same turn, `out_of_energy` wins over
`out_of_action_budget`. This explicit precedence keeps client, server, replay,
and agent evaluation from reporting different terminal reasons.

The helper does not spend resources, reject an action before execution, or
decide whether reaching a cap is checked before or after settlement. The product
must call it at its authored point in the turn pipeline.

## Suggested thresholds

`suggestStarThresholds(minimumActions)` derives starting values from a
solver-measured minimum:

```ts
{
  three: Math.ceil(minimumActions * 1.34),
  two: Math.ceil(minimumActions * 1.85),
}
```

These ratios are authoring suggestions, not a claim about difficulty. Validate
them with human and agent play, then store the chosen values in product content.
Changing authored thresholds does not require changing the SDK engine.

## Determinism checklist

- Count canonical submitted actions consistently across all runtimes.
- Define whether rejected/no-op actions consume budget.
- Apply costs and terminal checks at one documented phase.
- Store thresholds and caps with the level version used by replay.

## Zonoid example

Zonoid stores per-level suggested-action thresholds and calls `scoreStars` only
after the universal reducer has settled a winning turn. Story and Challenge
levels therefore share the same 1–3 star calculation, while Energy capacity
and autonomous action limits remain product policy and are checked separately.
Zonoid uses solver measurements as authoring input, then tunes thresholds with
human and agent play.
