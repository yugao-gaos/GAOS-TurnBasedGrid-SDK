# Gates

`resolveGateTransition` is a pure state machine for abstract open/closed gates.
The product supplies activation and occupancy after resolving its switches,
links, power, pressure plates, or other sources.

## Modes

- `latch`: activation opens a closed gate permanently. Loss of activation does
  not close it.
- `automatic`: activation opens the gate; loss of activation closes it only
  when the gate cell is unoccupied.

## Transition table

| Current | Active | Occupied | Mode | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| closed | true | any | either | open / `opened` |
| closed | false | any | either | unchanged |
| open | true | any | either | unchanged |
| open | false | any | latch | unchanged |
| open | false | false | automatic | closed / `closed` |
| open | false | true | automatic | unchanged |

Omitted `occupied` behaves as false. Occupancy protects only automatic closing;
it does not prevent an active closed gate from opening.

```ts
const next = resolveGateTransition({
  mode: gate.mode,
  state: gate.state,
  active: linkedSources.some((source) => source.active),
  occupied: actors.some((actor) => sameCell(actor.at, gate.at)),
});

if (next.changed) {
  gate.state = next.state;
  events.push({ type: next.transition, gateId: gate.id });
}
```

## Settlement integration

Gate activation often participates in a same-turn cycle: movement presses a
switch, linked state updates, a gate opens, transport advances, then the switch
changes again. Run transitions as explicit jobs or inside a bounded
[transport interlock](transport.md), not through an unbounded global update loop.

Evaluate occupancy from committed authoritative state at the moment closing is
considered. Animation position should never decide whether a gate can close.

## Product responsibilities

The SDK does not define source lookup, AND/OR link logic, keys, locks, gate
cells, crushing, pathfinding updates, sounds, or animation. It returns the next
abstract state plus `changed` and a nullable transition so products can commit
and present the result exactly once.

## Zonoid example

Zonoid maps switches and powered plugs to two gate modes. A weighted switch or
plug can latch a door open permanently, while an automatic door closes after
its source turns off only when no actor occupies the doorway. The platform
computes linked activation and occupancy, then uses this SDK transition to
update the door and emit one `opened` or `closed` event.
