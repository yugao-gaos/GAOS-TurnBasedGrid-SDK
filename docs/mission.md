# Mission: games as shared benchmarks

## Our mission

**GAOS exists to make interactive games a shared, inspectable proving ground
for human and machine intelligence—where both act through the same rules, face
the same consequences, and can be compared through reproducible play rather
than persuasive outputs alone.**

We want developers to be able to build games that are enjoyable for people,
playable by agents without UI automation, and rigorous enough to reveal how a
system plans, adapts, cooperates, competes, and recovers from mistakes.

That requires more than exposing a model API. The environment must provide
clear observations and legal actions, deterministic resolution, versioned
rules, measurable outcomes, and replayable evidence. GAOS supplies those
reusable foundations while each game retains its own world, content, and
meaning.

## What we mean by a benchmark

A useful game benchmark is not one level, one model score, or one leaderboard.
It is a versioned evaluation system:

```text
environment + task suite + action protocol + metrics + replay evidence
```

The environment defines what can happen. The task suite samples different
skills and situations. The protocol gives every participant the same legal
interface. Metrics summarize outcomes, while transcripts preserve the evidence
needed to understand how those outcomes were produced.

Scores are useful, but they are not sufficient. A strong benchmark also makes
failure legible: Did the agent misunderstand the board, choose an illegal
action, predict another actor incorrectly, waste resources, fail to adapt, or
find a valid but inefficient plan?

The portable unit of evidence is an SDK-owned replay, not a platform-specific
database row. A TabletopLabs creator game can emit the same `gaos.replay` JSONL
as a hosted Arena run, allowing either result to be parsed, routed to its pinned
historical reducer, and verified by shared tooling. That is the benchmark
mission in operational form: a game authored in one product becomes
independently Arena-verifiable.

## Why games are a good approach

### They measure behavior over time

A static question measures one response. A game measures a sequence of choices
under changing state. Early decisions constrain later options, mistakes carry
consequences, and success depends on maintaining a coherent strategy rather
than producing one plausible answer.

### They combine capabilities naturally

One compact scenario can require spatial reasoning, planning, memory, resource
management, tool use, communication, uncertainty, cooperation, and adaptation.
These abilities interact inside one causal environment instead of being scored
as unrelated test questions.

### Humans and agents can share the same task

When both use the same rules and action space, human play provides an
interpretable reference rather than a separate benchmark. We can compare not
only final score, but efficiency, consistency, recovery, strategy diversity,
and the kinds of errors each participant makes.

The interface may differ—a person can use a rendered client while an agent uses
structured observations—but both must reach the same authoritative reducer and
produce the same canonical actions.

### Games are repeatable without being static

Seeds, authored variations, hidden information, different opponents, and new
levels can create many controlled situations from one ruleset. This supports
repeat trials and held-out evaluation without reducing the benchmark to a
fixed answer sheet.

### They produce inspectable evidence

Every turn can be recorded as an observation, legal-action set, chosen action,
state transition, event trace, and outcome. Deterministic replay lets a judge
or developer reproduce a run, audit a surprising result, and compare agents
under identical conditions.

### They can remain worth playing

A benchmark that is also a game has a continuing source of difficult,
human-legible tasks. Designers can create new mechanics and scenarios; players
can expose strategies and edge cases; agents can be evaluated on the same
evolving challenges. Enjoyment does not guarantee scientific validity, but it
helps the environment stay alive rather than becoming a solved worksheet.

## Why use a grid

Grids make spatial state discrete, compact, and inspectable. Cells provide
stable identities for movement, distance, collision, line of sight, resource
claims, and causal traces. A structured grid observation is also independent
of rendering quality, screen resolution, input timing, and computer-vision
noise.

That does not make grid worlds trivial. Partial observability, simultaneous
actors, dynamic terrain, multi-cell entities, linked systems, projectiles, and
long settlement chains can create deep planning problems while preserving an
exact authoritative state.

The renderer can still be expressive for people. The benchmark core remains a
deterministic state machine that a server, solver, replay checker, and agent can
all execute without reproducing the visuals.

## Why simultaneous turn-based play

Sequential turn-taking gives the later actor information about the earlier
actor's committed move. Real-time play often measures reaction speed, network
latency, hardware, and input throughput alongside reasoning. Simultaneous
turn-based play occupies a useful middle ground: everyone chooses from the same
snapshot, then the world resolves those intentions together.

```text
shared observation
       ↓
participants choose independently
       ↓
intents close for the turn
       ↓
deterministic simultaneous resolution
       ↓
same-turn consequences settle
       ↓
next shared observation
```

### It tests prediction, not response order

An actor cannot simply wait to see the opponent's committed move. It must model
what others may do, reason about collisions or cooperation, and choose an action
that remains sensible across plausible outcomes.

### It removes speed as an accidental advantage

Humans and models may need very different amounts of deliberation. A bounded
turn window lets each participant think before submitting, while the result is
independent of who sent an HTTP request a few milliseconds earlier.

### It makes concurrency fair and explicit

All intents qualify against one turn snapshot. Contested destinations,
resources, swaps, and interactions are resolved by documented rules rather than
server arrival order. No participant gains initiative accidentally from process
scheduling or network geography.

### It creates richer multi-agent reasoning

Simultaneous choices expose coordination, trust, signaling, competition,
conflict avoidance, and opponent modeling. Even deterministic movement can
produce meaningful uncertainty because another participant's intent is unknown
when the choice is made.

### It remains reproducible

Turn inputs are finite and canonical. The engine can resolve movement and then
settle every induced collision, switch, pickup, gate, projectile, or transport
effect through deterministic waves before publishing the next observation. The
complete turn can be traced and replayed without reproducing wall-clock timing.

## Comparison

| Property | Real-time | Sequential turns | Simultaneous turns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reaction speed affects results | Often | Rarely | No, within the turn limit |
| Later actor sees earlier action | Continuously | Yes | No |
| Request order can create advantage | Often | Defined by turn order | No |
| Opponent prediction is required | Mixed | Reduced for later actor | Central |
| Exact replay is straightforward | Difficult | Yes | Yes |
| Slow model participation | Awkward | Natural | Natural |
| Concurrent conflict is explicit | Timing-dependent | Mostly absent | Core mechanic |

Simultaneous turns are not universally better. Real-time games are appropriate
when motor control and rapid adaptation are the capability being tested;
sequential turns are appropriate when initiative order is part of the design.
GAOS focuses on simultaneous turn-based systems because they isolate strategic
decision quality while retaining meaningful multi-agent interaction.

## Principles for credible evaluation

GAOS encourages benchmark authors to:

1. **Use one authoritative reducer.** Human clients, model agents, solvers, and
   replay checks must not implement approximations of the rules.
2. **Expose concrete legal actions.** Do not score agents mainly on guessing an
   undocumented command syntax.
3. **Version rules and content.** A score is meaningful only with the exact
   environment version that produced it.
4. **Separate outcome from evidence.** Keep scores for comparison and complete
   transcripts for diagnosis.
5. **Evaluate across tasks and seeds.** One level or lucky run is not a robust
   measure.
6. **Keep held-out challenges.** Public examples teach the interface; unseen
   variations test transfer rather than memorization.
7. **Report efficiency and failure modes.** Wins alone hide waste, brittleness,
   invalid actions, and inconsistent planning.
8. **Compare under equal conditions.** Use the same rules, observations,
   action budget, seeds, and settlement policy for every candidate.

## What GAOS does not claim

Performance in a game is evidence about performance in that environment. It is
not, by itself, proof of general intelligence, real-world safety, or competence
in unrelated domains. Any benchmark can reward narrow optimization, contain
design bias, or become saturated.

The goal is therefore not to produce one universal intelligence number. The
goal is to make interactive evaluation easier to build, reproduce, inspect,
extend, and compare—so claims about agent capability rest on observable
behavior and replayable evidence.
