# Next-version batch implementation review

Status: complete for the additive v0.13–v0.16 scope · Reviewed against the
updated 58,209-byte handoff bundle

This review treats the five RFCs and Appendix A as one acceptance contract.
The implementation remains product-neutral and preserves every v0.12 rename
as a deprecated alias until the separately scheduled v1.0 boundary.

## Determinism and atomicity findings

- Every mechanism consumes stable product ids and explicit seeds; none mints
  random identity or reads wall-clock time.
- Zone and portal planning is mutation-free. Group/capacity failures do not
  partially apply, and arrival callbacks run only after a complete commit.
- Hidden zone order remains canonical in authoritative state but is never
  exposed through conventional seat views.
- Portal and simultaneous-intent arbitration use documented total ordering.
- Target enumeration reports truncation. Generic agents and the solver reject
  a partial target surface rather than silently treating it as complete.
- Replays preserve board, zone, seat, target, and tick addressing.
- `gaos.replay` preserves those reducer inputs inside one portable single- or
  multi-level evidence artifact that Arena and creator platforms can share.

## Compatibility and intentional boundaries

These are not implementation gaps:

- Deprecated v0.12 aliases remain available through v0.16 exactly as promised.
  Removing them belongs to the breaking v1.0 release.
- Product reducers own card meaning, legal actions, costs, effects, terrain,
  fog memory, portal activation, authoritative persistence, and serialization.
- Wager pools, negotiation, adversarial search, continuous physics, schedulers,
  realtime transport, NAT/signaling, and cryptographic hidden-information
  protocols remain explicitly out of SDK scope.
- Pure peer-to-peer lockstep cannot protect full hidden state from a modified
  peer. Optimistic P2P plus server replay provides deterministic integrity and
  dispute resolution, while competitive confidentiality requires an
  authoritative session resolver (for example, a per-match Durable Object)
  that sends only seat-redacted views.
- Solver search remains defined for open-information, discrete decision
  spaces. Products may provide snapshots around mutable high-frequency state.

## Final gap disposition

No unimplemented normative requirement remains in the current additive
v0.13–v0.16 batch. The only scheduled work beyond this batch is the explicit
v1.0 alias removal/package-boundary decision and future consumer-driven
features that the RFCs list as out of scope.
