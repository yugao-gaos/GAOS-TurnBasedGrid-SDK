# GAOS turn protocol v1

The stable protocol coordinates turns without imposing a particular game's
state, observation, or command shape. Values crossing the wire must be JSON
serializable.

## Resolved turns

A resolved envelope contains:

- `protocol: "agilabs.turns"`
- `protocolVersion: "1.0"`
- `kind: "turn"`
- `sessionId`, `turnId`, and monotonic `revision`
- a game-owned `turn` observation

Only resolved envelopes advance a renderer or agent.

## Pending turns

A simultaneous host can accept one participant's committed intent before the
other participants have submitted. It returns `kind: "pending"` with:

- the same unresolved cursor;
- the last resolved observation;
- submitted and awaited participant lists; and
- the accepted participant when applicable.

A pending envelope acknowledges an intent but does not advance the world.

## Commands and retries

Every command submission binds the command to the current `sessionId`,
`turnId`, and `revision`. It also includes:

- a portable participant ID matching `[A-Za-z0-9_.:@-]{1,128}`;
- a caller-generated `submissionId`; and
- a game-owned `command` value.

Reuse the same `submissionId` for an exact retry. Use a new ID for a new
logical control step. A host rejects stale cursors and conflicting retries.

## Simultaneous resolution

The protocol collector stores one intent per participant without mutating its
input window. Once complete, it returns intents in canonical ASCII participant
order rather than network arrival order. The game resolves that complete batch
once; the collector never approximates simultaneous play by applying commands
serially.

The host is responsible for atomically committing the resolution, its retry
receipt, and the next intent window.

## Game definitions

`GameDefinition` is an optional host-side seam for deterministic games. A game
owns its configuration, state, observation, command, and legal-command types.
It supplies state creation, participant enumeration, observation, legality,
and complete-batch resolution.

`GameRegistry` is instance-local and permits multiple explicit versions of a
game to coexist in one host process.

## Host responsibilities

Participant IDs identify seats, not credentials. Authentication,
authorization, persistence, timeout policy, reconnect behavior, rate limits,
scoring, and replay retention belong to the host.

## Compatibility promise

The v1 compatibility boundary covers:

- envelope metadata and cursor semantics;
- resolved versus pending behavior;
- command idempotency and conflict behavior; and
- deterministic complete-batch intent collection.

Additive metadata may appear under `extensions`. Game-specific observations,
commands, endpoints, and policies are not frozen by protocol v1. A breaking
change to the generic fields or behavior requires a new protocol version.
