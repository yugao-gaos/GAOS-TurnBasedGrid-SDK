# Version history

GAOS evolves additively across the v0.x line. Products can adopt new mechanism
families independently, while deprecated compatibility names remain available
until the v1.0 boundary.

::: tip Current source: v0.16.0
The latest batch expands GAOS from a grid-focused engine into a composable
tabletop mechanism suite: heterogeneous boards, hidden information, zones,
card-play composition, portals, high-frequency lockstep, and multi-agent
episodes.
:::

## Tabletop mechanism suite

### v0.16.0 — portals and multi-agent play

Prepared July 23, 2026.

- Atomic portal planning and commit across square, hex, and graph boards and
  ordered, bag, or slotted zones.
- Bounded multi-hop traversal, cycles, groups, footprints, transformations,
  destination capacity, and deterministic contention.
- Frame skipping for decision-point agents with transcript v1.2.
- Seat-redacted `MultiAgentEnvironment` episodes with canonical simultaneous
  batches and per-seat rewards.
- Authoritative hidden-information deployment guidance, including per-match
  server resolvers and optimistic P2P dispute verification.

### v0.15.0 — zones and card composition

Prepared July 23, 2026.

- Ordered, bag, and sparse slotted zones with atomic transfers.
- Seeded shuffle, draw, round-robin dealing, and batch dealing.
- Keyword layers, response priority, declarative targets, durations, phase
  hooks, and deck/squad validation.
- Priority resource claims for contested draft picks and capacity.

### v0.14.0 — information partitions

Prepared July 23, 2026.

- Deterministic `viewFor(state, seat)` observations.
- Independent identity and order visibility for zones.
- Fog-of-war, entity shells, leak assertions, revelations, teams, spectators,
  and ranked multi-seat outcomes.
- Turn order, participation descriptors, pattern matching, sparse tick
  transcripts, rollback resimulation, and state digests.

### v0.13.0 — neutral core and layouts

Prepared July 23, 2026.

- Genre-neutral reducer, action, solver, and replay names.
- Deprecated v0.12 aliases retained with equivalent behavior.
- `LocationRef` addressing across multiple containers.
- Square, axial-hex, and directed-graph layouts with generic pathfinding,
  line-of-sight, fields, and keyed movement.

## Compatibility policy

- v0.13 through v0.16 are additive.
- Existing single-board and perfect-information reducers continue to work.
- The old `Grid*` core names remain deprecated aliases through v0.x.
- v1.0 removes those aliases and is the next intentional breaking boundary.
